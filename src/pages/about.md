![alt text](about-me.jpg)

I'm a platform engineer with over 10 years of experience in software and cloud, specialising in building scalable, secure, and efficient cloud infrastructure. I currently reside in London, UK.

## My Journey

My passion for technology started with a curiosity about how systems work behind the scenes. Over the years, I’ve evolved from writing simple scripts to architecting and automating cloud environments for large-scale applications. From startups to enterprise systems, every project has taught me new ways to optimise and innovate.  

## What I Do  

I focus on designing and managing robust cloud platforms that enable seamless development and deployment. 

My expertise includes:

- Cloud infrastructure automation with Terraform  
- CI/CD pipeline optimisation for efficient deployments  
- Kubernetes and container orchestration  
- Security, compliance, and disaster recovery planning  
- Observability and monitoring for system reliability  

## Beyond the Cloud  

When I’m not engineering solutions, you’ll find me:  
 
- Exploring new DevOps tools and automation techniques  
- Runnning, cycling, and staying active outdoors  
- Testing productivity hacks to streamline workflows
- Experimenting with high-fidelity sound systems
