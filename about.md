- I am a software engineer and a writer interested in the interplay between thoughts and constraints, the duality of interpretations and representations, and the nature of abstractions and correspondence between them. 

- On this website I write articles about [[Computer Science::/tags/#Software]], and [[Generic Life Stuff::/tags/#General]]. Sometimes I also [[review::/tags/#Review]] books that I've read. You can find my programming side-projects on [[github::https://www.github.com/rgvr]]
  
- If you find anything interesting about who I am or what I do, please do reach out to me. ðŸ‘‡

## Reach out to me

- Shoot me a dm or just tweet ***[[@rgvrme::https://twitter.com/renekabanda]]***. I will try to reply as soon as I can.
